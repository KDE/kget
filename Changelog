        * transfer.{h,cpp}: The transfer class has been completely rewritten. Now
        it is possible to implement a new Transfer simply inheriting the Transfer
        class and implementing the virtual methods.
        There is also a new api that allows each view to ask the transfer which
        particular field in the Info struct has changed since the last update. This
        results in a big optimization becouse we can now avoid unnecessary repaints.
        
        * transferKio.{h,cpp}: This is the first implemented transfer. It's the 
        simplest transfer one can implement since it uses a KIOSlave.
        
        * views/mainview.{h,cpp}: New view that should be the main one. It
        reimplements the KListView class. The "special features" list contains
        the introduction of some cool icons and a new progress bar.
