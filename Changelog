        * group.{h,cpp}: This file introduces the Group and GroupList classes.
        
        * panels/groupspanel.{h,cpp}: This is the new "group panel". It's far
        from complete, but at least we can add/remove groups, this gets notified
        to all the views and saved to the "transfers.kgt" together with the
        transfers

        * transfer.{h,cpp}: The transfer class has been completely rewritten. Now
        it is possible to implement a new Transfer simply inheriting the Transfer
        class and implementing the virtual methods.
        There is also a new api that allows each view to ask the transfer which
        particular field in the Info struct has changed since the last update. This
        results in a big optimization becouse we can now avoid unnecessary repaints.
        
        * transferKio.{h,cpp}: This is the first implemented transfer. It's the 
        simplest transfer one can implement since it uses a KIOSlave.
        
        * views/mainview.{h,cpp}: New view that should be the main one. It
        reimplements the KListView class. The "special features" list contains
        the introduction of some cool icons and a new progress bar.

        * transferlist.{h,cpp}: Api semplifications. In this moment there are some
        new problems I have just discover and I will fix tomorrow.
        
        * transferlist.{h,cpp}, transfer.{h,cpp}: The way kget saves the transfers
        into the transfers.kgt file has been completely rethinked. The code has been
        rewritten from scratch and now it uses QDom. In this way each new transfer can,
        if needed, save its own data that isn't already saved by the Transfer class.
        
        * some fixes..
