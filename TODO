        TODO
---------------------
                        
SHORT-TERM (URGENT):

  FIX #09 <dario> the konqueror plugin doesn't allow the download of links if 
      the relative web page has been closed
  FIX #10 <dario> when resizing the columns of the mainview and the groupspanel
      the items are not updated correctly
  ADD #11 <dario> implement the GlobalStatus object and make the 
      systray to update using the ViewInterface slots instead of the actual hack.
  ADD #12 <dario> once #11 has been implemented, implement progressive filling
      of the icon in the system tray
  ADD #13 <dario> make it possible to move transfers to a specific group using 
      the popup menu.
  ADD #14 <dario> make it possible to drag a transfer in a group inside the
      mainview or in the groups visible in the groupspanel.
  CHG #24 <dario> verify that the painting operations in the views are performed
      only when necessary.
  CHG #25 <dario> optimize if possible the fact we must check if a transfer
      is still present in the transfers list (in the Scheduler class, function
      slotTransferChanged() ). 

MID-TERM:

  ADD #15 <dario> change the actual way we use the priority for each transfer.
      In the future it will describe the precise order the transfers will be 
      downloaded.
  ADD #16 <dario> use KPassivePopups to notify when all the transfers have been
      downloaded.
  CHG #26 <dario> profile kget and look for possible optimizations.
  CHG #17 <dario> finish to implement transferKio adding, for example, setDelay.
  ADD #18 <dario> add the possibility to select "open destination folder" in 
      the transfer's popup menu.
  ADD #19 <kget> bitTorrent support
  CHG #21 <kget> setup a decent gui with a decent toolbars.
  CHG #22 <kget> sync the configuration options with what has currently been 
      implemented.
  ADD #23 <dario> make it possible to associate a default folder to each group.

LONG-TERM:

  ADD #20 <kget> make the TestView able to make intensive tests on kget by
      giving commands to the Scheduler and looking if what happens is what should
      happen.
  CHG #05 <dario> usability enhancements as in #79519
  ADD #07 <dario> sidebar for transfer statistics and more (bandwidth
      graph, alternative urls, connection status/type, virtual folders,
      ...)
  ADD #02 <kget> add bandwidth limiting
  ADD #03 <kget> splits download in N segments
  ADD #01 <kget> support for mirrors
  ADD #08 <dario> 'low priority downloads' as in br #50776.
  ADD #04 <kget> add Help & Guide

  
        DONE
---------------------


  Things done until 06/11/04 (when this file has been adopted)
  
  CHG #06 <dario, eros> decoupling between gui and transfer operations.
  ADD <dario> Implement the MainView class that should become the kget main view.
  CHG <dario> Transfer object rewrite to make it easily inherited from 
      new kind of transfers.
  ADD <dario> TransferKio. The first transfer realized using kioSlaves
  CHG <dario> Scheduler logic enhancement (there are still lots of things to do)
  ADD <dario> groups support and notifies to the views.
  ADD <dario> systray icon with blinking overlay.
  CHG <eros> Move all the configuration framework to KConfigXT
  CHG <dario> implement delayedInitialization of the kget app. This should speed up
      the startup a lot with big lists of transfers.
  
  

IDEAS:


DISCUSSING:
   * Remember to move downloaded Transfers in a black-list that will be
     deleted when program exits. So old pointers to downloaded items are
     still valid when the transfer ends.
