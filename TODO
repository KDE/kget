    IN PROGRESS

        TODO
---------------------

SHORT-TERM (URGENT):

  -- MAINWINDOW --

  -- SCHEDULER --

  -- SIDEBAR --
  ADD <dario> re-import the sidebar (and think about a better one).
  ADD <dario> add a "Finished" (is this the best name?) item. This will point
      to the downloaded files.
  ADD <dario> add a popupmenu to add or delete groups by right-clicking on them.

  -- MAINVIEW --
  ADD <dario> make it possible to drag a transfer in a group inside the
      mainview or in the groups visible in the groupspanel.
  ADD <dario> Implement the selection of a specific group. In this way 
      selecting a group from the sidebar should display only its transfers.
  ADD <dario> add a coloured band over the mainview displaying the currently
      display items. For example if I select "Downloads" from the sidebar it
      should display "Downloads". If instead I select a specific group <groupname>
      it should display "Downloads - <groupname>"
  ADD <dario> handle the situation when we remove a group which has transfers.

  -- BITTORRENT PLUGIN --
  FIX <dario> when stopping a transfer immediately after having started it, the
      plugin crashes.
  FIX <dario> sometimes, the bittorrent plugin blocks all the kget gui for
      some seconds.
  FIX <dario> if we have a torrent file and we make some copies of it with
      different names, and then we add all the torrents to kget, kget crashes
  FIX <dario> the transfer should switch its status to finished when we start
      an already downloaded file.

  -- MISCELLANEOUS --
  ADD <dario> implement the GlobalStatus object and make the
      systray to update using the ViewInterface slots instead of the actual hack.
      To make this happen we need to create also a special group containing all
      the ungrouped Transfers. Then we just need to sum the progress of each group
      to know the global download percentage.
  ADD <dario> implement progressive filling of the icon in the system tray
  CHG <pino> verify that all the settings are respected
  ADD <pino> implement the grouping functionalities
  ADD <dario> in order to have all the necessary informations to calculate a
      global progress percentage, we need to know the size of each transfer
      in the list. This is currently not the case. Now we have this information
      only for the already started transfers. Maybe we should add a stat() virtual 
      function to the transfer that makes the transfer retrieve all the necessary
      informations. Then we should also create a Job, returned by the Transfer 
      factory, to be added to the scheduler ( that's the new scheduler power ;-) ).

MID-TERM:

  ADD <dario> change the actual way we use the priority for each transfer.
      In the future it will describe the precise order the transfers will be 
      downloaded.
  ADD <dario> use KPassivePopups to notify when all the transfers have been
      downloaded.
  CHG <dario> profile kget and look for possible optimizations.
  ADD <kget> bitTorrent support
  CHG <kget> setup a decent gui with a decent toolbars.
  CHG <kget> sync the configuration options with what has currently been 
      implemented.
  ADD <dario> make it possible to associate a default folder to each group.
  ADD <pino> tooltips and what's this for settings
  ADD <pino> implement the notifications
  ADD <dario> add a wizard on the first app execution, where the user can set
      his download folders and other "vital" settings like the integration with
      Konqueror. Perhaps we could provide a good default like ~/downloads/.
  ADD <pino> make the sidebar capable of several sizes for its items (16, 22,
      32, ...)

LONG-TERM:

  ADD <kget> make the TestView able to make intensive tests on kget by
      giving commands to the Scheduler and looking if what happens is what should
      happen.
  CHG <dario> usability enhancements as in #79519, #89379, #111407
  ADD <dario> sidebar for transfer statistics and more (bandwidth
      graph, alternative urls, connection status/type, virtual folders,
      ...)
  ADD <kget> add bandwidth limiting (#87600)
  ADD <kget> splits download in N segments (#62371)
  ADD <kget> support for mirrors (#62371)
  ADD <dario> 'low priority downloads' as in br #50776.
  ADD <kget> add Help & Guide
  ADD <uwolfer> show average transfer speed when finished (#49219)
  ADD <uwolfer> resume option when there is a file with the same name (#51450)
  ADD <uwolfer> preserve timestamp of downloaded files (as option) (#55511)
  ADD <uwolfer> recursion and other wget features (#57105)
  ADD <uwolfer> make KGets handling of many downloads smarter 
      (maximum number of open connections per server) (#57248)
  ADD <uwolfer> check there is enough space left before downloading file (#57373)
  ADD <uwolfer> save referer page for downloads (#60946)
  ADD <uwolfer> built-in signature verification support (#61397)
  ADD <uwolfer> right-click menu to change file properties 
      (filename, destination directory, url) (#72534, 82923)
  ADD <uwolfer> add support for mms:// protocol (#96386)
  ADD <uwolfer> add valid download time frame, global or individual (#109377)


        DONE
---------------------


  Things done until 21/01/2005

  CHG <dario, eros> decoupling between gui and transfer operations.
  ADD <dario> Implement the MainView class that should become the kget main view.
  CHG <dario> Transfer object rewrite to make it easily inherited from 
      new kind of transfers.
  ADD <dario> TransferKio. The first transfer realized using kioSlaves
  CHG <dario> Scheduler logic enhancement (there are still lots of things to do)
  ADD <dario> groups support and notifies to the views.
  ADD <dario> systray icon with blinking overlay.
  CHG <eros> Move all the configuration framework to KConfigXT
  CHG <dario> implement delayedInitialization of the kget app. This should speed up
      the startup a lot with big lists of transfers.
  FIX <dario> the konqueror plugin doesn't allow the download of links if 
      the relative web page has been closed
  FIX <pino> make more fluid the drop target movement
  FIX <dario> handle SideBar resizing correctly
  CHG <dario> finish to implement transferKio adding, for example, setDelay.
  FIX <dario> (JJ) fix crash when resuming an already running transfer. The 
      solution should be to check for this case in Scheduler::slotSetCommand
      by calling the info() function on the transfer and checking if its status
      is St_Trying or St_Running. In this case we should do nothing.
  FIX <dario> (JJ) fixed Sidebar crash.
  FIX <dario> fixed 'stop on transfer' crash
  FIX <enrico> Optimized color scheme change (rebuilds pixmaps, droptarget,
      etc) and pixmap deletion (leakfix)
  CHG <enrico> disabled internal segv hander to show backtraces on crash
  ADD <dario> make it possible to move transfers to a specific group using
      the popup menu.

  Things done after the big architecture rewrite

  CHG <dario> rename the KMainWidget class (that IMHO is a rather confusing name)
      to MainWindow (KGet? KGetWindow?)
  ADD <dario> add the possibility to select "open destination folder" in 
      the transfer's popup menu.

IDEAS:
   * Use the single transfer dialog to display transfer property, progress and
     to set up advanced options of a transfer, like its splitting into chuncks.


DISCUSSING:
   * Remember to move downloaded Transfers in a black-list that will be
     deleted when program exits. So old pointers to downloaded items are
     still valid when the transfer ends.
