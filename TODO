        TODO
---------------------

SHORT-TERM (URGENT):

  CHG <kget> Change the way KDE Global Progress Tracking work (Refactor / Rewrite) (BUG: 213084, 218766) - 80% completed
  CHG <kget> Stop All action doesn't stop the transfers with setted policy at Running
  CHG <kget> Related to BUG: 220516. You can reproduce this by unplugging your ethernet connection for some seconds and
             connecting it again. Nobody will never put the download in the Delayed status, and the transfer will be stuck
             without ever going on.
  CHG <kget> Downloading from websites like rapidshare.com seems to have problems when one downloads a file as a free user
             with the multithread plugin. Seems like just one of the chunks (the first one?) works, and the transfer gets
             stuck at the percentage of 1 / (# of chunks) * 100. Allow  the first chunk to complete the entire download if
             necessary?
  CHG <kget> Transparency problems reported by Enrico Ros. Have still to download the video that demonstrates the problems.
  CHG <kget> Disable popup notifications when we have the system tray jobs activated

KDE 4.5:
  CHG <kget> Make the global Status tracking show the filename if only one file is downloading at a time

MID-TERM:

  -- MULTISOURCEDOWNLOAD --
  ADD <boom1992> For each Transfer-Plugin, which supports speedlimits, there should be a button for "Add source", not sure if for 4.1 (depends on the plugins if they want to..)
  ADD <boom1992> Move some kind of AdvancedDetails to core, with "Peer-View", "Chunks-View", "File-View" and perhaps that status of sources (that will come with 4.2 hopefully)
  ADD <boom1992> Speedlimits support for every DataSource, which is able to do that

  ADD <dario> implement progressive filling of the icon in the system tray
  CHG <pino> verify that all the settings are respected
  ADD <boom1992> let the user add new download-sources to a multithreaded transfer manually
  ADD <boom1992> Ask the user if he/she wants to delete the transfer (or probably if he/she wants to delete the tmp-file)?
  ADD <boom1992> Move deleting of big tmp-files to a new thread
  ADD <boom1992> Change "Regular expression -> Folder" to "Regular expression -> Group"
  ADD <pino> tooltips and what's this for settings
  ADD <dario> add a wizard on the first app execution, where the user can set
      his download folders and other "vital" settings like the integration with
      Konqueror. Perhaps we could provide a good default like ~/downloads/.

LONG-TERM:

  ADD <kget> make the TestView able to make intensive tests on kget by
      giving commands to the Scheduler and looking if what happens is what should
      happen.
  CHG <dario> usability enhancements as in #79519, #89379, #111407
  ADD <dario> sidebar for transfer statistics and more (bandwidth
      graph, alternative urls, connection status/type, virtual folders,
      ...)
  ADD <kget> add bandwidth limiting (#87600)
  ADD <dario> 'low priority downloads' as in br #50776.
  ADD <kget> add Help & Guide
  ADD <uwolfer> resume option when there is a file with the same name (#51450)
  ADD <uwolfer> preserve timestamp of downloaded files (as option) (#55511)
  ADD <uwolfer> recursion and other wget features (#57105)
  ADD <uwolfer> make KGets handling of many downloads smarter 
      (maximum number of open connections per server) (#57248)
  ADD <uwolfer> check there is enough space left before downloading file (#57373)
  ADD <uwolfer> save referer page for downloads (#60946)
  ADD <uwolfer> built-in signature verification support (#61397)
  ADD <uwolfer> right-click menu to change file properties 
      (filename, destination directory, url) (#72534, 82923)
  ADD <uwolfer> add valid download time frame, global or individual (#109377)
  ADD <boom1992> write a ML-Donkey-plugin, based on libkmldonkey
  ADD <boom1992> Proxy-support, not global, only for kget (we need to wait for kdelibs)
  ADD <boom1992> Various small improvements: #134456, #81219, #150391, #150447, #121318(we should add it to transfer-history), searchbar for mainwindow, Nepomuk integration??, strigi integration (with transfer-history)??
  ADD <boom1992> DC++-Plugin
  ADD <boom1992> GUI to create Metalinks 

        DONE
---------------------


  Things done until 21/01/2005

  CHG <dario, eros> decoupling between gui and transfer operations.
  ADD <dario> Implement the MainView class that should become the kget main view.
  CHG <dario> Transfer object rewrite to make it easily inherited from 
      new kind of transfers.
  ADD <dario> TransferKio. The first transfer realized using kioSlaves
  CHG <dario> Scheduler logic enhancement (there are still lots of things to do)
  ADD <dario> groups support and notifies to the views.
  ADD <dario> systray icon with blinking overlay.
  CHG <eros> Move all the configuration framework to KConfigXT
  CHG <dario> implement delayedInitialization of the kget app. This should speed up
      the startup a lot with big lists of transfers.
  FIX <dario> the konqueror plugin doesn't allow the download of links if 
      the relative web page has been closed
  FIX <pino> make more fluid the drop target movement
  FIX <dario> handle SideBar resizing correctly
  CHG <dario> finish to implement transferKio adding, for example, setDelay.
  FIX <dario> (JJ) fix crash when resuming an already running transfer. The 
      solution should be to check for this case in Scheduler::slotSetCommand
      by calling the info() function on the transfer and checking if its status
      is St_Trying or St_Running. In this case we should do nothing.
  FIX <dario> (JJ) fixed Sidebar crash.
  FIX <dario> fixed 'stop on transfer' crash
  FIX <enrico> Optimized color scheme change (rebuilds pixmaps, droptarget,
      etc) and pixmap deletion (leakfix)
  CHG <enrico> disabled internal segv hander to show backtraces on crash
  ADD <dario> make it possible to move transfers to a specific group using
      the popup menu.

  Things done after the big architecture rewrite

  CHG <dario> rename the KMainWidget class (that IMHO is a rather confusing name)
      to MainWindow (KGet? KGetWindow?)
  ADD <dario> add the possibility to select "open destination folder" in 
      the transfer's popup menu.

IDEAS:
   * Use the single transfer dialog to display transfer property, progress and
     to set up advanced options of a transfer, like its splitting into chuncks.


DISCUSSING:
   * Remember to move downloaded Transfers in a black-list that will be
     deleted when program exits. So old pointers to downloaded items are
     still valid when the transfer ends.
